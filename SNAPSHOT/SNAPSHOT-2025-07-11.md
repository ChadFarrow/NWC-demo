## Summary of Today's Work

- **metaBoost Tag Support:**
  - Detected and displayed the `<podcast:metaBoost>` tag and endpoint in the UI for each value block.
  - Added a "Send Test Boost" button for the metaBoost endpoint, allowing test POSTs from the browser.
  - Implemented CORS support on the metaBoost API endpoint for browser compatibility.

- **metaBoost-Aligned Payment Flow:**
  - Updated the payment form to follow the [Podcastindex metaBoost proposal](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/discussions/676):
    - Users pay with any wallet (NWC, LNURL, Lightning, etc.).
    - Users paste the payment proof (preimage, invoice, etc.) into the form.
    - The app POSTs boost metadata (including payment proof) to the metaBoost endpoint.
  - The flow is now payment-method agnostic and future-proof, with no direct wallet integration required.

- **UI/UX Improvements:**
  - Fixed value block ordering so Show Value Block appears above episode-level blocks.
  - Improved metaBoost tag parsing for namespace-agnostic detection.

- **Deployment:**
  - Deployed all changes to Vercel, confirmed the metaBoost endpoint is live and CORS-enabled.
  - Confirmed end-to-end test boost and metaBoost metadata flows are working.
